# Game Description Migration

This migration adds game descriptions to your database to improve page load performance by eliminating the need to fetch descriptions from the RAWG API on every page load.

## What Changed

1. **Database Schema**: Added a `description` column (TEXT) to the `games` table
2. **Models**: Updated the `Game` model to include the description field
3. **Storage**: Modified storage methods to save descriptions when fetching from RAWG API
4. **API**: Updated the `/api/game` endpoint to use stored descriptions instead of fetching from API
5. **Migration Script**: Created `populate_game_descriptions.py` to populate existing games

## Steps to Complete the Migration

### 1. Add the Database Column

First, you need to add the description column to your database. Run this SQL command:

```sql
ALTER TABLE games ADD COLUMN description TEXT;
```

### 2. Run the Migration Script

Execute the migration script to populate descriptions for all existing games:

```bash
python populate_game_descriptions.py
```

**Requirements:**
- `RAWG_API_KEY` environment variable must be set
- Database connection must be configured
- Internet connection to fetch from RAWG API

**What the script does:**
- Finds all games without descriptions
- Fetches descriptions from RAWG API (with rate limiting)
- Cleans HTML and truncates descriptions to 2,500 characters
- Updates the database with the descriptions
- Provides progress updates and a summary

### 3. Verify the Migration

After running the script, you can verify it worked by:

1. Checking the script output for success/failure counts
2. Querying a few games to see if they have descriptions:
   ```sql
   SELECT name, LENGTH(description) as desc_length FROM games WHERE description IS NOT NULL LIMIT 5;
   ```

## Benefits

- **Faster Page Loads**: No more API calls for descriptions
- **Better User Experience**: Instant description display
- **Reduced API Dependency**: Less reliance on external API
- **Improved Reliability**: No more API rate limiting issues

## Storage Impact

- **Typical description size**: 1,000-2,500 characters (~2-4 KB per game)
- **100 games**: ~200-400 KB additional storage
- **1,000 games**: ~2-4 MB additional storage
- **10,000 games**: ~20-40 MB additional storage

The storage overhead is minimal compared to the performance benefits.

## Troubleshooting

### Script Fails to Start
- Ensure `RAWG_API_KEY` is set in your environment
- Check database connection settings
- Verify all required Python packages are installed

### Some Games Failed to Update
- This is normal for games not found in RAWG database
- Run the script again to retry failed games
- Check the script output for specific error messages

### Database Column Already Exists
- The script will detect this and skip the column check
- It will only populate games that don't have descriptions

## Future Game Creation

New games will automatically have their descriptions fetched and stored when:
- A new game is created via the Discord bot
- Game credits per hour are updated
- RAWG data is refreshed for existing games

The system will continue to work seamlessly with the new description storage.

# Migration: Add session_date column and index for gaming_sessions

This migration will:
- Add a generated column `session_date` (date part of timestamp) to the `gaming_sessions` table (if not present)
- Add an index on `(user_id, session_date)` for fast per-user, per-day queries

## How to run

1. Save the migration script (see below) as `migrate_add_session_date.py` in your project root.
2. Make sure your Postgres connection string is set in the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.
3. Run:
   ```bash
   python migrate_add_session_date.py
   ```
