This is a web app designed to track and display gamer cred, a semi-arbitrary point system designed to measure an individual's awareness and experience of video games.
The whole thing is made with Ai, but I am learning to code rn in the hopes that I will be able to take the project over one day and optimize it.
Right now, it is inneficient, slow, and hard to update, as I am relying on an ai to get the job done.
It does function, though, and I have many more plans for it in the future.
